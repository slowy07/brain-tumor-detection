## We Develop with Github
We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be commented for information
3. Make sure your code lints.
4. commit with simple information, example:
   - `docs: adding documentation or fixing documentation`
   - `fix: fix some code with change minor and major`
   - `update: update more spesific code for more efficient`

## Report bugs or some question using Github's [issues](https://github.com/slowy07/brain-tumor-detection/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/slowy07/brain-tumor-detection/issues/new); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code
[This is an example](http://stackoverflow.com/q/12488905/180626) of a bug report I wrote, and I think it's not a bad model. Here's [another example from Craig Hockenberry](http://www.openradar.me/11905408), an app developer whom I greatly respect.
